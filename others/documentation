Basic Technology Requirements:
We have fulfilled all the five required technologies.
First technology: HTML/CSS/Javascript
Examples: client folder, imports folder
Second Technology: React+Redux, Meteor “Front_End”
imports/ui
Third Technology: NodeJS, Meteor “Back_End”
imports/api
Fourth Technology: NoSQL and MongoDB
Fifth Technology: Release Engineering (Project Deployment)

Basic Contribution Requirements:
Kyo took a substantial leadership role on Meteor back_end (api), project deployment
Hugo took a substantial leadership role on Meteor front_end, mongoDB and react+redux setup
Eric took a substantial leadership role on defect discovery & testing, demo script, and documentation

Basic Functionality Requirements:
We have fulfilled all the functionality requirements that we planned to do for our app. 
We created this app to help investors evaluating and analyzing public companies of their interest. 
Investors will have easier access to the company’s performance (time-series graph, time vs. price) and 
the company’s financial statement based on the selected timelines. 

Challenges, learning, and future directions: 
Problem 1: limitations of how often an individual user can request data from the stock price api server 
(because the stock price api is free, the api only allows for a certain number of free requests)
Solution: We learned to use built-in methods to set a timer interval, so api requests are not sent too frequently.
Example code: imports/startup/server/index.js

Initiative and additional contributions: 
We used react hooks in our project. https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html
We also used webpack in our project. https://webpack.js.org/
