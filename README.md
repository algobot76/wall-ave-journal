## Project Description

### Who is it for?

The project we are aiming to build is a visualization tool for users who are interested in understanding the price movements of a given publicly traded company.

### What will it do?

We will be presenting a graphical representation of price movement of a given publicly traded company. Specifically, it will be a time-series graph where the horizontal axis will be labeled with time and vertical axis will be labelled with price.

In addition, we intend to attach quarterly financial statements on days when they are released and specific color node will be used to reflect such important information release. This will allow users to easy access to such information.

### What type of data will it store?

The data stored in the project is of many forms. Specifically, data for the price movement of a particular company are of numerical value or strings. Data for the financial statements are links to the quarterly financial report.

### What will users be able to do with this data?

Users can compile all the data to perform fundamental analysis of a given publicly traded company.

### What is some additional functionality you can add or remove based on time constraints?

We are hoping to add news links to days where important news are released for a given publicly traded company.  And category the release based on the source it came from so that users can analyze the tone that a particular news outlet is projecting for this company.
